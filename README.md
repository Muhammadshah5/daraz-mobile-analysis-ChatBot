# Daraz Mobile Product Analysis & Chatbot System

This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of mobile products from Daraz.pk, an e-commerce platform. It involves sophisticated web scraping, data storage, and the development of an interactive chatbot system. The extracted data is analyzed and presented through insightful visualizations in a dashboard.

## Project Overview

The project consists of three main components:

1. **Web Scraping:**
   - Objective: Extract mobile product data from Daraz.pk, focusing on the first five pages of search results.
   - Tools: Utilize Selenium or BeautifulSoup for web scraping to extract product details such as name, price, brand, and reviews.
   - Key Focus: Filtering out irrelevant products by setting conditions to exclude listings that contain keywords like "case," "cover," or "charger."

2. **Chatbot Development:**
   - Objective: Develop a chatbot capable of handling user queries based on the scraped data.
   - Implementation: Utilize natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to understand and accurately respond to complex queries.
   - Example: The chatbot can respond to queries such as "What is the best phone under $300?" by analyzing user ratings and prices from the stored data.

3. **Dashboard Development:**
   - Objective: Create an interactive dashboard to visually present the scraped data.
   - Elements: The dashboard includes input fields for querying data, total number of listings, average product price, average ratings, average review count per product, and top products based on defined criteria.
   - Tools: Utilize Flask, Django, or any other frontend technology for dashboard development.

## Evaluation Criteria

The success of the project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Successful extraction of relevant mobile products and reviews.
- Effective storage and retrieval of data from files or a database.
- Functional chatbot capable of understanding and responding to user queries.
- Implementation of scraping refinement techniques to exclude irrelevant products.
- Well-designed and interactive dashboard providing key statistics and insights.
